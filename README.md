## 📥 Data Ingestion Pipeline

### Step 1: AWS S3 Setup
- Created dedicated **S3 bucket** for storing raw agricultural data
- Uploaded `data_season.csv` containing ~1000+ rows of agricultural metrics
- Configured appropriate access permissions and bucket policies

### Step 2: Snowflake Integration with AWS S3

#### IAM Role Creation
- Created **AWS IAM role** with S3 read permissions
- Configured **trust policies** to allow Snowflake service principal access
- Applied principle of least privilege with specific S3 bucket access

#### Snowflake Configuration
```sql
-- External Stage Creation
CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE agricultural_stage
  URL = 's3://your-bucket-name/data/'
  CREDENTIALS = (AWS_ROLE = 'arn:aws:iam::YOUR-ACCOUNT:role/snowflake-role')
  FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = 'CSV' SKIP_HEADER = 1);

-- Verify Stage Connection
LIST @agricultural_stage;
```

#### Trust Policy Configuration
Updated AWS S3 bucket policy and IAM role trust relationships to enable secure cross-service authentication without exposing credentials.

---

## 🔄 Data Transformation & Preparation

### ETL Operations Performed

#### 1. Data Loading from S3
```sql
-- Copy data from S3 to Snowflake
COPY INTO agricultural_raw_data
FROM @agricultural_stage
FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = 'CSV' SKIP_HEADER = 1)
ON_ERROR = 'SKIP_FILE';
```

#### 2. Data Cleaning & Validation
- Handled null and missing values
- Standardized data types across numeric and categorical fields
- Validated rainfall, temperature, humidity, and yield ranges
- Removed duplicate records and inconsistencies

#### 3. Data Transformation
- **Aggregations**: Calculated average metrics by year, season, crop, and location
- **Feature Engineering**: Created derived columns for seasonal analysis
- **Data Enrichment**: Added calculated fields for yield efficiency metrics
- **Dimensional Tables**: Normalized crop, location, and season dimensions

#### 4. Analytical Tables
Created optimized tables for Power BI consumption:
```sql
-- Fact Tables
CREATE TABLE fact_agricultural_data AS
SELECT year, location, crop, season, area, rainfall, temperature, 
       humidity, yields, price, irrigation_type, soil_type
FROM cleaned_data;

-- Dimension Tables
CREATE TABLE dim_locations AS
SELECT DISTINCT location FROM fact_agricultural_data;

CREATE TABLE dim_crops AS
SELECT DISTINCT crop FROM fact_agricultural_data;

CREATE TABLE dim_seasons AS
SELECT DISTINCT season FROM fact_agricultural_data;
```
